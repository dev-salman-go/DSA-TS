# 🚀 TypeScript Data Structures & Algorithms 🧠

Welcome to my **TypeScript Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This project is dedicated to solving various **DSA problems** while honing TypeScript skills in a structured and organized way. 💻

## 📂 Folder Structure

All files are neatly organized in a multi-directory folder structure based on data structures, algorithms, and problem types. The structure ensures clean separation and easy navigation.

```bash
├── Array/
│   ├── reverseArray.ts
│   ├── twoSum.ts
│   └── ... 
├── LinkedList/
│   ├── singlyLinkedList.ts
│   ├── mergeTwoSortedLists.ts
│   └── ...
├── String/
│   ├── palindrome.ts
│   ├── longestSubstring.ts
│   └── ...
├── Graph/
│   ├── graphTraversal.ts
│   ├── shortestPath.ts
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

## 💡 Key Features

- **📝 Multiple DSA Concepts**: Explore **arrays**, **linked lists**, **graphs**, **trees**, and more.
- **🚀 Efficient Algorithms**: Solutions optimized for time and space complexity.
- **📖 Well-Documented Code**: Each file is self-documented, explaining the thought process behind the solution.
- **🔥 Hands-On Learning**: Focus on practical problem-solving to master TypeScript and DSA.

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-dsa-repo.git
    cd your-dsa-repo
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run TypeScript files**:

    You can compile and run any `.ts` file using the following commands:

    ```bash
    # To compile TypeScript
    tsc <path-to-your-file>.ts

    # To execute using Node.js
    node <path-to-your-file>.js
    ```

4. **Run tests** (if applicable):

    To test solutions, you can run:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

## 🏗️ Data Structures Covered

- **Array**: Manipulate arrays with various algorithms (e.g., searching, sorting, reversing)
- **Linked List**: Implement and solve problems for singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stack & Queue**: LIFO/FIFO structures and their applications.
- **HashMap/HashSet**: Efficient lookups and usage in different algorithms.
- **Tree**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversal techniques.
- **Graph**: BFS, DFS, shortest paths, and more.

## 🔥 Algorithms Covered

- **Sorting Algorithms**: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, etc.
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solve complex problems with recursion and memoization.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Get optimal solutions step by step.
- **Backtracking**: Explore all possibilities to find solutions.
